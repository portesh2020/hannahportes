      <h2>Applied ML</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>This final report was created using this 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avazu-ctr-prediction/overview"> 
          click-through-rate dataset </a> from kaggle. The data contains over 1,000,000 rows 
          and 23 features which are a mix of numeric and categorical variables, including the 
          target feature click: 0/1. We carry out systematic steps to preprocess the data
           - including missing value removal and imputation, standardization of variables and 
           encoding of categorical features. After using various ML techniques to build models, 
           we will utilize hyperparameter tuning to pick the optimal parameters and leverage 
           several different evaluation metrics to measure the model performances in order to 
           choose the most efficient one.

    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>This course covers theoretical underpinnings, architecture, performance 
        and applications of neural networks and deep learning (DL). 
        The course uses Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and the Google Cloud platform. This final 
        project evaluated and recreated the findings of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861"> <span class="citation">MobileNets:

      <h2>Information Ethics, Law, and Policy</h2>


    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>This course inspired my academic concentration. It explores the ethical,
        legal, and policy foundations of information technology. Over the course of the
        semester we addressed contemporary challenges from privacy in big data and
        social computing to the nature of innovation, property, and collaboration in
        a networked world.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>Networks II examines how the computing, economic, sociological, and natural worlds
        are connected and how the structure of these connections impacts each field.
        This course teaches how to construct mathematical models to understand and
        analyze network settings, enabling us to predict behavior in these systems.

      <h2>Designing Technology for Social Impact</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>This course focuses on the social impact of technologies in the design process.
        We analyze the values embodied in technology design through science and
        technology studies. We further explore what social and cultural values
        technology designs promote and to what degree technology design can
        impact the world and society for which it is created.</p>

      <p>Human-Computer Interaction Design is centered around user experience (UX) design
        and the lify cycle of design from the user perspective. This course covers the key
        aspects of human-centered design, from understanding and analyzing user needs,
        to exploring design solutions, creating prototypes, and evaluating the usability of
        these prototypes through interviews and usability testing. </p>

      <h2>Envisioning America: Nineteenth-Century US Poetry and Prose</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="right">

      <p>This course explores the voices that shape the ways we understand
        ourselves which emerged within the first few hundred
        years of the United States' formation. This course focuses on poetry
        by Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and prose of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry
        David Thoreau. The course then examines slavery, abolitionism, the
        Civil War, and the evolution of American ideals through the writings of
        Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and Margaret Fuller. These voices
        shape the way we think of freedom and political resistance. Finally,
        we finish the course by studying the poetry of popular poets, such as
        Edgar Allen Poe, William Cullen Bryant, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

      <p>"Powerful voices emerged in the United States' first hundred years
        that continue to reverberate and to shape the ways in which we
        understand ourselves as Americans." - Cornell Course Website</p>
