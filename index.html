      <!-- <h1>About Me</h1> -->

      <div>

        <p>I completed my Bachelors of Science in
          Information Science at Cornell University class of 2020. Through my studies I
          discovered my interest in analytics and the constant evolution
          of theories and practices explored in my curriculum.

      <p>

        After graduating I moved to Boston to work for The Depository Trust and Clearing
        Corporation (DTCC) as a full-stack developer where I worked as the lead UI
        resource on my team alongside experienced Java developers. I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science in 
        Computer Science at Columbia University.
        <br>
        <br>
        I discovered my interest in the field after I too some exploratory
        math and technology related courses. I have a background in topics
        from basic statistics, to new applications of Game
        Theory, to analyzing contemporary problems with innovation and
        collaboration in the technology industry. I have cultivated skills
        in technical computing and mathematics as well as a comprehension
        of information policy, ethics, argumentation, and persuasion that
        I am enthusiastic to apply in the real world.
